## Current Features

### Remote Administration Tool (RAT)

### Usage

1. **Login**: Users must first authenticate using valid credentials to access the RAT's features.
2. **Keylogging**: Once logged in, users can activate the keylogging functionality to capture keystrokes on the target machine.
3. **SMTP Integration**: Captured keystrokes are securely transmitted via email using SMTP integration, ensuring efficient delivery to designated recipients.
4. **Batch Processing**: The RAT allows for batch processing, enabling users to automate predefined tasks on remote machines.


## TODO

- **Injection on Targets**: Implement injection capabilities to allow users to execute custom commands or scripts on target machines remotely. This feature will enhance the RAT's functionality by enabling users to perform a wider range of actions on remote systems.

- **Screen Capture**: Develop screen capture functionality to capture screenshots of the target machine's desktop or active windows. This feature will provide users with visual insights into the target system's activities and enhance monitoring capabilities.
